# Who I am and where I came from

My family and I are from Puerto Rico, but we moved to Chesapeake,
Virginia when I was just 4 years old since my dad was stationed at the
naval base near by. From a young age I had a love for animals and my
family always encouraged me to become a veterinarian. Chesapeake is a
very southern town in Virginia and I never liked it much so I had my
heart set on leaving the state for college. That is how I ended up at
[Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/). I moved to
Colorado in 2020 and still don't feel like I know the state very well,
but I have really enjoyed my time here.

My major is in Zoology and out of all the classes I have taken, genetics
was my favorite. The concepts really clicked in my head and I left every
lecture wanting to know more about what we were discussing. Although my
primary goal is to become a veterinarian I also love learning and want
to pursue subjects that I enjoy. And so, out of all the genetics related
courses being offered this semester I found myself drawn to this class.

I am so fortunate to say that I work at [CSU's Veterinary Teaching
Hospital](https://vetmedbiosci.colostate.edu/vth/) in Internal Medicine
and Community Practice as an assistant. I have learned so much at work
from the faculty doctors, residents, interns, technicians, and vet
students. Internal Medicine introduced me to the research side of
veterinary medicine and that is something I hope to do as a veterinarian
one day.

I have a busy schedule with school and work, but I always make sure I
have at least some free time to prevent burnout. When I have free time
my top four things to do are:

1.  Watching movies (either by myself or with my friends),
2.  Listening to music (I like basically any genre, except country...)
3.  Listening to true crime podcasts,
4.  Expressing my creativity through journaling and drawing.

I want to mention that all of my favorite leisure activities can be done
with my cats, Thunder and Dawson, present. They are 14 year old liter
brothers and I have had them since I was 7, so I love them very much.

# Research Interests

I don't have specialized research interests at this point in my career,
but I think that by learning more about bioinformatics I will find
something that I can be interested in pursuing.

## Influential papers

Since I have not performed any research, yet, I have chosen two papers
that I have enjoyed reading in my studies. One aspect of genetics that I
have been able to watch grow since I was first introduced to is
CRISPR-Cas9. I learned about CRISPR in highschool and remember how
excited my biology teachers were about the potential of CRISPR-Cas9
related to genetic engineering.

When I initially learned about the CRISPR-Cas9 system, the paper by
@doudna2014new was very influential. Now in college I have been able to
keep up with the new developments in research using CRISPR-Cas9
[@sharma2021crispr].

## The mathematics behind my research

I haven't had the chance to dive into super complex mathematics yet, but I do still have my notes from my ecology course so I found some equations to use from there. 

We worked with the logistic growth equation when modeling population dynamics of two competing species. First we just looked at the logistic growth equation as it is:
$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rN(1-\frac{N}{K})$$
Then we altered the equation to account for two species and their competition coefficients:
$$\frac{dN_1}{dt}=r_1N_1(1-\frac{N_1+\alpha N_2}{K_1})\\\frac{dN_2}{dt}=r_2N_2(1-\frac{N_2+\beta N_1}{K_2})$$

I also worked with the species-area curve:
$$S=cA^z$$
And the more graph friendly form of the equation:
$$log (S)=log(c) +z (log(A))$$

## My computing experience

I have no experience with with any programming languages, so I went ahead and looked up some examples!

I found JavaScript is one and got this example:
```JavaScript
  function myFunc(a, b) {
      return a * b;
  }
  document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = myFunc(4, 3);
```
And then I found an example of Python:
```Python
  words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
  for w in words:
      print w, len(w)
```
## What I hope to get out of this class

I hope that I can:

-   Learn more about bioinformatics and different tools used in this field.
-   Get an idea of the different types of research that involve analyzing high-throughput sequencing.
-  Create a baseline understanding in these concepts to be able to potentially incorporate them in my future career.
